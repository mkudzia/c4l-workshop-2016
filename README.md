Our outline and notes and workshop materials for Code4Lib 2016, the "Getting Ready for Workshops" workshop

Many of us go to conferences that offer code workshops, which is great! However, differences in hardware, operating system, and familiarity with things like package managers can make participation tricky. There are some great code workshops being offered at Code4Lib this year! Our goal with this workshop is to get your laptop into shape to participate more fully, and provide a space to ask questions and troubleshoot.

Here's the [outline](outline.md) of what we'll cover.
