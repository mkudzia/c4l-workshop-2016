# Code4Lib "Getting Ready for Workshops" Workshop 2016
Many of us go to conferences that offer code workshops, which is great! However, differences in hardware, operating system, and familiarity with things like package managers can make participation tricky. 

There are some great code workshops being offered at Code4Lib this year! Our goal with this workshop is to get your laptop into shape to participate more fully, and provide a space to ask questions and troubleshoot.

## Code of Conduct
We expect participants to comply with the Code4Lib code of conduct [http://bit.ly/coc4lib](http://bit.ly/coc4lib). The local contact person for any concerns you may have during this workshop is **TODO: fill in with info from committee.

We find the following suggestions useful when we're trying to learn, so we're committed to trying them here. In a learning evironment, things which are not helpful include:
* Feigning surprise: "Wait, you didn't know that _____ ?!" is usually not a helpful reaction; please don't do this.
* Well, actually: If you feel that someone (including one of us) has missed something important in our explanation of something, please do mention it. However, we prefer more of a "yes, and" approach -- in practice, sentences that start with "well, actually" tend to be more about making the person speaking feel smart, than about advancing everyone's understanding.
* Back-seat driving: There is a difference between hearing that someone is struggling and going over to try and help, and listening with half an ear and lobbing advice intermittently across the room. We love for people to work together and help each other out, but please engage meaningfully when you do so.
These suggestions were inspired by what used to be the Hacker School rules (now called the Recurse Center rules) -- more info [here](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules).
