# Code4Lib "Getting Ready for Workshops" Workshop 2016
Many of us go to conferences that offer code workshops, which is great! However, differences in hardware, operating system, and familiarity with things like package managers can make participation tricky. There are some great code workshops being offered at Code4Lib this year! Our goal with this workshop is to get your laptop into shape to participate more fully, and provide a space to ask questions and troubleshoot.

Here's the [outline](outline.md) of what we'll cover.

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:
* Download, install, and use a text editor
* Access and minimally navigate the command line
* Find their environment variables and edit them if necessary
* Download a VirtualBox and get it running
* Download and install a programming language
