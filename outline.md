# Outline
This workshop is designed to help you set up your laptop so that you can more easily participate in code workshops. To this end, we’re going to cover:

1. Text Editors
2. The Command Line (the basics)
3. Programming Languages
4. Environment Variables
5. Virtual Environments

We’ll be using an fictional example throughout the workshop; for our purposes, our example character will be Elizabeth Bennet (from Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice). Because we like Jane Austen, and her writings are off copyright :)
